## ✨ Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🎸 Interactive Fretboard Explorer
Tap fret positions on a visual ukulele fretboard (standard GCEA tuning, frets 0–12) and the app instantly detects and displays the chord. Supports 9 chord types: Major, Minor, Dom7, Min7, Maj7, Diminished, Augmented, Sus2, and Sus4.

### 📚 Chord Library
Browse playable voicings for any chord. Select a root note, category (Triad, Seventh, Suspended, Extended), and chord type to see algorithmically generated voicings displayed as mini fretboard diagrams.

### 🔄 Transpose
Shift chords up or down by semitones with +/- buttons. Shows the capo equivalent for easy reference.

### 🥁 Strumming Patterns
A reference guide with 8 common ukulele strumming patterns — from beginner (All Downs, Island Strum) to intermediate (Calypso, Ska). Each pattern includes visual beat arrows, notation, description, and suggested tempo.

### 🎶 Chord Progressions
Common chord progressions for any key, in both major and minor scales. Includes Pop, Classic Rock, 50s, Folk, Jazz ii-V-I, Reggae, and more. Tap any chord chip to jump to its voicings.

<td width="50%">

### 🎼 Scale Overlay
Highlight notes from any of 7 scales (Major, Minor, Pentatonic Major/Minor, Blues, Dorian, Mixolydian) directly on the fretboard. Root notes shown with a distinct color.

### ⭐ Favorites
Long-press any voicing in the Chord Library to save it. Access your saved voicings from the dedicated Favorites tab.

### 📝 Song Chord Sheets
Create a personal songbook with lyrics and inline chord markers (e.g., `Some[C]where over the [Em]rainbow`). Tap any chord name to view its voicings.

### 📅 Chord of the Day Widget
A home screen widget that displays a new chord each day with its name, finger positions, and notes.

### 🔊 Sound Playback
Hear chords played back using sine wave synthesis. Notes are strummed with a configurable delay between strings.

### 🎓 Music Theory & Learning
Theory lessons, ear training, interval trainer, circle of fifths, glossary, scale practice, spaced repetition, achievements, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (latest stable — Ladybug or newer)
- JDK 11+

### Clone & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baijum/ukulele-chords.git
cd ukulele-chords
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### Run on Emulator or Device

Open the project in Android Studio, select a device/emulator, and click **Run** (or press `Shift+F10`).

### Release Build

1. Create a `keystore.properties` file in the project root:

```properties
storeFile=path/to/your/keystore.jks
storePassword=your_store_password
keyAlias=your_key_alias
keyPassword=your_key_password
```

2. Build the release bundle:

```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

The AAB will be at `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.

## 🤝 Contributing

**Contributions are welcome!** Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or refactoring code — we'd love your help.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. **Make your changes** and test them
4. **Commit** with a clear message (`git commit -m "Add: description of change"`)
5. **Push** to your fork (`git push origin feature/my-feature`)
6. **Open a Pull Request** describing what you changed and why

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Contributing

We actively encourage contributors to use **AI coding tools** to accelerate their work on this project. The codebase is well-structured and AI-friendly:

- **Use [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), or similar AI tools** to explore the codebase, understand patterns, and generate code that fits the existing architecture.
- **Leverage AI for code reviews** — before submitting a PR, ask an AI assistant to review your changes for consistency with the project's patterns.
- **Use AI to write tests** — the project currently has no automated tests (see [Good First Issues](#-good-first-issues) below), making it a perfect opportunity for AI-assisted test generation.
- **AI-powered documentation** — use AI tools to help write clear commit messages, PR descriptions, and inline documentation.

> **Tip:** This project uses standard Kotlin + Jetpack Compose patterns. AI tools work exceptionally well with the codebase because it follows consistent conventions throughout.

### 🟢 Good First Issues

Looking for a place to start? Here are some areas where contributions would be especially valuable:

| Area | Description | Difficulty |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Unit Tests** | Add tests for `ChordDetector`, `Transpose`, `CapoCalculator`, and other domain logic | Beginner |
| **UI Tests** | Add Compose UI tests for screens and components | Beginner |
| **Accessibility** | Improve content descriptions and TalkBack support | Beginner |
| **New Scales** | Add more scale types to the Scale Overlay feature | Beginner |
| **New Strumming Patterns** | Expand the strumming pattern library | Beginner |
