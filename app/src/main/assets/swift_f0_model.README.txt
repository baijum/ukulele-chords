Place the SwiftF0 ONNX model in this directory as:

  swift_f0_model.onnx

Notes:
- Source: https://github.com/lars76/swift-f0 (model.onnx from pip package/release)
- Expected by code: app/src/main/assets/swift_f0_model.onnx
- If the model file is missing, the app gracefully falls back to YIN-only tuning.
