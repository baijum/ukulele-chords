/**
 * Represents a chord type defined by its interval structure relative to the root note.
 *
 * In music theory, a chord is defined by the set of intervals (in semitones)
 * from its root note. For example, a major triad has intervals {0, 4, 7},
 * meaning: root, major third (4 semitones), perfect fifth (7 semitones).
 *
 * @property symbol The display suffix appended to the root note name (e.g., "" for major,
 *   "m" for minor, "7" for dominant seventh).
 * @property quality A human-readable description of the chord quality
 *   (e.g., "Major", "Minor 7th").
 * @property category The [ChordCategory] this formula belongs to.
 * @property intervals The set of semitone intervals from the root that define this chord type.
 * @property omittable Intervals that may be dropped when there are fewer strings than notes
 *   (e.g., the perfect fifth in a 9th chord on a 4-string ukulele). Empty for chords
 *   with 4 or fewer notes.
