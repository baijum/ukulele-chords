        // ── Ukulele facts & history ──
        "The ukulele originated in Hawaii in the 1880s, adapted from the Portuguese machete brought by immigrants from Madeira.",
        "\"Ukulele\" roughly translates to \"jumping flea\" in Hawaiian, possibly describing the quick finger movements on the strings.",
        "The four standard ukulele sizes are soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone — each with a distinct voice and scale length.",
        "Standard ukulele tuning (G-C-E-A) uses a re-entrant high G string, making it higher in pitch than the C string next to it.",
        "Low-G tuning replaces the re-entrant G with a wound string an octave lower, extending the range and giving a warmer, guitar-like sound.",
        "The ukulele gained worldwide popularity after the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco.",
        "Jake Shimabukuro's 2006 YouTube video of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" helped spark the modern ukulele revival.",
        "Israel Kamakawiwoʻole's medley of \"Over the Rainbow / What a Wonderful World\" is one of the most-streamed ukulele recordings ever.",

        // ── Music theory nuggets ──
        "A major chord is built from the root, major third, and perfect fifth — just three notes create that bright, happy sound.",
        "A minor chord swaps the major third for a minor third (one semitone lower), giving it a darker, more melancholic quality.",
        "The Circle of Fifths arranges all 12 keys so that each neighbouring key differs by just one sharp or flat.",
        "A semitone (half step) is the smallest interval in Western music — on the ukulele, it is one fret apart.",
        "The I-IV-V progression is the backbone of blues, rock, and countless pop songs across every genre.",
        "Seventh chords add a fourth note above the triad, creating richer harmony. Dominant 7ths drive resolution to the tonic.",
        "A pentatonic scale uses only five notes and is found in music traditions around the world, from blues to traditional Japanese music.",
        "Relative major and minor keys share the same notes but start on different degrees — for example, C major and A minor.",
        "An interval is the distance between two notes. Learning to hear intervals is one of the most powerful ear-training skills.",
        "Transposing a song means shifting every note up or down by the same interval, changing the key without altering the melody.",

        // ── Practice & playing tips ──
        "When learning a new chord shape, play each string one at a time to make sure every note rings clearly.",
        "Practice chord transitions slowly at first — smooth changes at a slow tempo build muscle memory faster than rushing.",
        "Using a metronome helps develop a steady internal pulse. Start at a comfortable BPM and gradually increase.",
        "Try fingerpicking patterns alongside strumming to unlock a whole new range of ukulele sounds.",
        "Placing a capo on a fret raises the pitch of all open strings, letting you play familiar shapes in a new key.",
        "Listening to a song multiple times before trying to play it helps your ear pick out chord changes and rhythm patterns.",
        "Muting strings with your fretting hand (palm mute or chuck) adds percussive rhythm to your strumming.",
        "Recording yourself and listening back is one of the fastest ways to spot areas for improvement.",
        "Learning the names of the notes on each string up to fret 5 makes navigating the whole fretboard much easier.",
        "Even a few minutes of focused daily practice is more effective than long, infrequent sessions.",
