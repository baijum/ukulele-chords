# Uke (Ukulele Companion) - Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 8, 2026

## Overview

Uke (Ukulele Companion) is a free, open-source ukulele learning app.
Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app
accesses and how it is handled.

## Data We Do Not Collect

Uke does **not**:

- Collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- Use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs
- Require an account or login to use core features
- Send any data to external servers (the app works fully offline)

## Microphone Access (RECORD_AUDIO)

The app requests microphone access **only** for the optional **Tuner** feature.
When you use the Tuner, the app listens to audio from your device's microphone
to detect the pitch of your ukulele strings in real time.

- Audio is processed **entirely on your device** and is never recorded, saved, or transmitted.
- Audio data is discarded immediately after pitch detection; no audio buffers are retained.
- The microphone is only active while the Tuner is running. It stops as soon as you leave the Tuner screen or tap "Stop."
- If you deny microphone permission, every other feature of the app continues to work normally.

## Google Drive (Optional)

If you choose to sign in with Google for backup/sync, the app accesses only its
own app-specific folder on your Google Drive. It does not read or modify any
other files on your Drive. Google's own privacy policy applies to Google
Sign-In and Drive services.

## Local Storage

Preferences (tuning, theme, favorites, chord sheets) are stored locally on your
device using Android's standard storage mechanisms. This data stays on your
device unless you explicitly use the Google Drive sync feature.

## Children's Privacy

The app does not knowingly collect any information from children. It contains no
ads, in-app purchases, or social features.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the new version will be posted on this website with
an updated date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance
of the revised policy.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on the
project's GitHub repository.
