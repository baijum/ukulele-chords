    <h1>Uke (Ukulele Companion) — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Uke (Ukulele Companion) is a free, open-source ukulele learning app.
        Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app
        accesses and how it is handled.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Uke does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect, store, or transmit any personal information</li>
        <li>Use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs</li>
        <li>Require an account or login to use core features</li>
        <li>Send any data to external servers (the app works fully offline)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Microphone Access (RECORD_AUDIO)</h2>
    <p>
        The app requests microphone access <strong>only</strong> for the
        optional <strong>Tuner</strong> feature. When you use the Tuner, the
        app listens to audio from your device's microphone to detect the pitch
        of your ukulele strings in real time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Audio is processed <strong>entirely on your device</strong> — it is
            never recorded, saved, or transmitted anywhere.</li>
        <li>Audio data is discarded immediately after pitch detection; no audio
            buffers are retained.</li>
        <li>The microphone is only active while the Tuner is running. It stops
            as soon as you leave the Tuner screen or tap "Stop."</li>
        <li>If you deny microphone permission, every other feature of the app
            continues to work normally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Google Drive (Optional)</h2>
    <p>
        If you choose to sign in with Google for backup/sync, the app accesses
        only its own app-specific folder on your Google Drive. It does not read
        or modify any other files on your Drive. Google's own privacy policy
        applies to the Google Sign-In and Drive services.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Preferences (tuning, theme, favorites, chord sheets) are stored locally
        on your device using Android's standard storage mechanisms. This data
        stays on your device unless you explicitly use the Google Drive sync
        feature.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not knowingly collect any information from children. It
        contains no ads, in-app purchases, or social features.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        If this policy is updated, the new version will be posted at this URL
        with an updated date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes
        acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
        If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue
        on the project's GitHub repository.
