# Songs

The Songs section is your personal songbook. Create chord sheets with lyrics and inline chord markers, then use them as a reference while playing.

## Creating a Chord Sheet

1. Tap the **+ button** to create a new song.
2. Enter a **title** for the song.
3. In the content area, type your lyrics with chord markers using square bracket notation:

   ```
   Some[C]where over the [Em]rainbow
   [F]Way up [C]high
   ```

4. Tap **Save** to add the song to your collection.

## Viewing a Chord Sheet

Tap any song in the list to open it. The viewer renders your text with chords displayed inline above the lyrics in a highlighted style.

**Tap any chord name** in the viewer to jump directly to its voicings in the Chord Library. This makes it easy to look up unfamiliar chords while practicing a song.

## Auto-Scroll

The song viewer includes an **auto-scroll** feature so you can keep both hands on your ukulele while reading lyrics:

1. Tap the **play button** (floating action button) in the bottom-right corner to start auto-scrolling.
2. While scrolling, **speed controls** appear as chips: **1x**, **2x**, and **3x**. Tap a chip to change the scroll speed.
3. Tap the **stop button** (same FAB position) to stop auto-scrolling.
4. If you manually scroll or swipe the screen while auto-scroll is active, it pauses automatically.

This is especially useful during practice or performance when you cannot tap the screen to scroll manually.

## Transpose in Songs

The song viewer includes **transpose controls** to shift all chords up or down by semitones. This is helpful when a song is in a key that does not suit your voice or playing style. The original text is preserved — only the displayed chord names change.

## Editing and Deleting

- Tap the **edit button** on a song to modify its title or content.
- Tap the **delete button** to remove a song from your collection.
- Use the **share button** to export a song as text.

## Tips

- Use the `[ChordName]` bracket notation to mark chords anywhere in your lyrics.
- Auto-scroll at 1x speed is good for slow ballads; try 2x or 3x for faster songs.
- You can create chord sheets for any song — just type the lyrics and add chord markers where they belong.
