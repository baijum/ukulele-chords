# Progressions

The Progressions section shows common chord progressions for any key, in both major and minor scales.

## Browsing Progressions

1. **Select a key** — choose a root note at the top.
2. **Choose major or minor** — toggle between the two scale types.

The app displays a list of common progressions for that key: Pop (I-V-vi-IV), Classic Rock (I-IV-V), 50s (I-vi-IV-V), Folk, Jazz ii-V-I, Reggae, and more.

## Progression Cards

Each progression card shows:

- **Name** — the progression name (e.g., "Pop", "Jazz ii-V-I").
- **Roman numeral degrees** — the scale degrees used (e.g., I - V - vi - IV).
- **Chord chips** — the actual chord names in your selected key. Tap any chip to jump to its voicings in the Chord Library.

### Actions on Each Card

- **Play** — hear the progression played back with the current sound settings.
- **Share** — export the progression as text to share with others.
- **Voice Leading** — view smooth voice-leading suggestions between the chords.
- **Duplicate** — create a copy of the progression as a new custom progression with "(Copy)" appended to the name. Available on both preset and custom progressions. This is useful when you want to create a variant without changing the original.
- **Edit** — open the progression in the editor to rename it, add or remove chords, or change the scale type. Available on custom progressions only (presets cannot be modified).

## BPM and Tap Tempo

The progression playback bar includes a BPM slider to control the playback speed. Next to the slider is a **Tap Tempo** button — tap it rhythmically to set the BPM by feel. The app calculates the tempo from the intervals between your taps. After 3 seconds of inactivity, the taps reset so you can start fresh.

## Custom Progressions

You can create your own custom progressions by tapping the **+ button**. Custom progressions can be edited, duplicated, and deleted.

- **Edit** lets you change the name, chord sequence, or scale type of an existing custom progression.
- **Duplicate** creates a new independent copy you can modify separately.
- **Delete** permanently removes the custom progression.

## Tips

- Use progressions as a starting point for songwriting or practice sessions.
- Tap chord chips to quickly look up voicings you are not familiar with.
- Try the same progression in different keys to understand how transposition works.
- Use tap tempo when following along with a song to match its speed.
