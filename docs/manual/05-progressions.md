# Progressions

The Progressions section shows common chord progressions for any key, in both major and minor scales.

## Browsing Progressions

1. **Select a key** — choose a root note at the top.
2. **Choose major or minor** — toggle between the two scale types.

The app displays a list of common progressions for that key: Pop (I-V-vi-IV), Classic Rock (I-IV-V), 50s (I-vi-IV-V), Folk, Jazz ii-V-I, Reggae, and more.

## Progression Cards

Each progression card shows:

- **Name** — the progression name (e.g., "Pop", "Jazz ii-V-I").
- **Roman numeral degrees** — the scale degrees used (e.g., I - V - vi - IV).
- **Chord chips** — the actual chord names in your selected key. Tap any chip to jump to its voicings in the Chord Library.

### Actions on Each Card

- **Play** — hear the progression played back with the current sound settings.
- **Share** — export the progression as text to share with others.
- **Voice Leading** — view smooth voice-leading suggestions between the chords.
- **Duplicate** — create a copy of the progression. The copy appears as a new custom progression with "(Copy)" appended to the name. This is useful when you want to modify a progression without changing the original.

## Custom Progressions

You can create your own custom progressions by tapping the **+ button**. Custom progressions can be edited and deleted. The **Duplicate** button on any custom progression creates a new copy you can modify independently.

## Tips

- Use progressions as a starting point for songwriting or practice sessions.
- Tap chord chips to quickly look up voicings you are not familiar with.
- Try the same progression in different keys to understand how transposition works.
