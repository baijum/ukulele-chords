# Getting Started

## Installing the App

Ukulele Companion is available as an Android APK. Install it on any device running Android 8.0 (Oreo) or later. No account or login is required — just install and open.

## First Launch

When you open the app for the first time, you land on the **Explorer** tab. This is the interactive fretboard where you can tap fret positions and the app will detect chords for you.
