# Patterns

The Patterns section provides a reference guide for strumming and fingerpicking patterns with audio playback. Use the toggle chips at the top to switch between the two views.

## Strumming Patterns

The **Strumming** tab shows a list of preset strumming patterns, from beginner to advanced. Each pattern card includes:

- **Name** — e.g., "Island Strum", "Calypso", "Ska".
- **Difficulty badge** — Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced.
- **Play button** — tap the play icon to hear the pattern played on open strings. The currently active beat highlights as it plays. Tap the stop icon to stop playback. Only one pattern plays at a time.
- **Visual beat arrows** — down arrows, up arrows, chuck, and miss/pause indicators showing the rhythmic pattern. The active beat is highlighted during playback.
- **Notation** — a text representation of the pattern (e.g., "D - D U - U D U").
- **Description** — a brief explanation of the pattern and when to use it.
- **Genre tags** — musical styles the pattern suits (e.g., Hawaiian, Pop, Folk).
- **BPM slider** — adjust the playback tempo. Defaults to the midpoint of the pattern's suggested range.

### Creating Custom Patterns

Tap the **+ button** (floating action button) in the bottom-right corner to create your own strumming pattern:

1. Enter a **pattern name**.
2. Tap each **beat slot** to cycle through directions: Down, Up, Chuck, Miss, and Pause.
3. Tap the **accent row** below to toggle emphasis on individual beats (accented beats are shown louder/bolder).
4. Tap **Save** to add it to your custom patterns.

Your custom patterns appear in a **"My Patterns"** section at the top of the list. Each custom pattern has a **delete button** to remove it and supports playback like the preset patterns.

## Fingerpicking Patterns

The **Fingerpicking** tab shows reference patterns for fingerstyle playing. Each card includes:

- **Name** — e.g., "Arpeggio Up", "Travis Pick", "Clawhammer".
- **Difficulty badge** — Beginner or Intermediate.
- **Play button** — tap to hear each note plucked in sequence on the open strings. The active step highlights during playback.
- **Finger step display** — color-coded indicators showing which finger (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring) plucks which string (G, C, E, A) at each step. The active step is highlighted during playback.
- **Notation** — a text representation of the fingerpicking sequence (e.g., "T(G) T(C) I(E) M(A)").
- **Description** — guidance on technique and musical context.
- **BPM slider** — adjust the playback tempo.

The finger indicators use distinct colors for each finger, making it easy to follow the picking pattern visually. Emphasized steps are shown in a bolder weight.

### Creating Custom Fingerpicking Patterns

Tap the **+ button** on the Fingerpicking tab to create your own pattern:

1. Enter a **pattern name**.
2. Adjust the number of steps (2–8) with the +/− buttons.
3. Tap a step to select it, then choose the **finger** and **string** from the chip rows below.
4. Tap the **accent row** to toggle emphasis on individual steps.
5. Tap **Save** to add it to your custom patterns.

## Tips

- Start with the beginner patterns and work your way up.
- Use the **play button** to hear each pattern — listening is much more effective than reading notation alone.
- Adjust the **BPM slider** to start slow and gradually increase speed as you get comfortable.
- Playback uses the open strings of your selected tuning, so it matches whatever tuning you have configured in Settings.
- Create custom patterns to save patterns you learn from songs or teachers.
