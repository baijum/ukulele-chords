# Chords

The Chords section is a comprehensive chord library. Browse voicings for any chord by selecting a root note and chord type.

## Browsing Chords

1. **Select a root note** — tap one of the 12 note buttons at the top (C, C#, D, etc.). If you prefer flat names, you can switch this in [Settings](08-settings.md).
2. **Select a category** — choose from Triad, Seventh, Suspended, or Extended.
3. **Select a chord type** — for example, Major, Minor, Dom7, Min7, etc.

The app displays all available voicings as mini fretboard diagrams in a grid.

## Voicing Diagrams

Each diagram shows:

- The fret positions for each string.
- Open strings (played but not fretted) and muted strings.
- A small play button to hear the voicing.

**Tap** a voicing to load it onto the Explorer fretboard, where you can see it in full size.

## Saving Favorites

**Long-press** any voicing diagram to save it to your Favorites. A heart icon appears on voicings that are already saved. Tap the heart to remove it from favorites.

See [Favorites](06-favorites.md) for more about managing your saved voicings.

## Playing Voicings

Tap the **play button** on any voicing to hear it played back. The app strums the notes with the sound settings you have configured (volume, strum delay, note duration).

You can also play all voicings in sequence by using the play controls at the top of the voicing grid.
